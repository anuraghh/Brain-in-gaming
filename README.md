A project exploring the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning (ML), and real-time gaming. This repository aims to develop models and interfaces for using physiological or neural data to influence game dynamics, provide adaptive difficulty, or even act as a control input.

Features
Real-time Data Processing: Framework for capturing and processing data from NeuroSky Mindwave, Emotiv, or similar EEG (Electroencephalography) devices.

ML Integration: Contains machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Neural Networks) trained to classify mental states (e.g., focus, meditation, stress) from raw brainwave data.

Game API/Interface: Logic to translate classified mental states into game actions or parameters (e.g., adjusting game speed, character abilities, or in-game events).

Sample Game: A simple demonstration game (built in Unity/Pygame/etc.) showcasing the brain-gaming feedback loop.
